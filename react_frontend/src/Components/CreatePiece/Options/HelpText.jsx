  <ul>
    <li>Load: Opens a list of previously created pieces. Check the box next to the name of a piece and click the Load button to edit it further.</li>
    <li>Save: Saves the piece. You can now add the piece as a Pawn promotion option or a substitute for a regular piece, when starting a new game. The piece can't be saved if the name or image icons are blank. A Piece name cannot contain any special characters, click the Name tool's help icon for information.</li>
    <li>Reset: If you loaded a previously created piece than this will reset the piece's profile to the last time you saved it. If you're editing a new piece, the Reset option is the same as the Erase option.</li>
    <li>Erase: The Erase option removes all ranges and makes the name and image icons blank.</li>
    <li>Theme: As on other pages, this option will be to edit the color/image of the board, background, navigation bar, and tools, to either combinations included by the developer, or your own choice from what's available.</li>
  </ul>
