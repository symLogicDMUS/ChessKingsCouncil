    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>Don't pick images you've used for other pieces. If you do, don't use both pieces in the same game unless you're trying to be confusing. </li>	
        <li>Pick 2 images that look similar but are colored differently.</li>	
        <li>Don't pick an image that looks like a piece from regular Chess, especially if you're not going to substitute it for that piece.</li>	
        <li>Images that contain transparency, and/or are .svg files probably look better when playing.</li>	
    </ol>
