  <p>The Range display tool is a mini board that updates along with the game. Click any square on the mini board containing a piece, and the squares where that piece can move if it's that piece's color's turn are highlighted. This is useful for viewing where your opponent can move, as well as recalling the ranges of pieces you created. </p>    
  <p>Use the expand and colapse (<span className="ilb-ei"><img src="/Images/expand.svg" className="ilb-ei-img" alt="expand icon" /></span> and <span className="ilb-ei"><img src="/Images/unexpand.svg" className="ilb-ei-img" alt="unexpand-icon" /></span>) to show and hide the Range Display Board. </p>
