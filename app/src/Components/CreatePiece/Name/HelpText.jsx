<p>
Type the name of your piece and it will be added automatically. The name will appear above the board. The app will prevent you from saving your piece if your name contains any characters not allowed: The name cannot contain characters that are not letters, numbers, or underscores, and the first character cannot be a number. The name field cannot be left blank.  If you pick a name belonging to another piece, then the app will ask you if you want to replace that piece when saving.
