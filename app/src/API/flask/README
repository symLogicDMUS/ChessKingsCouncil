Methods with 'local' in the name, in this folder, are for using a Flask backend during development instead of Firebase,
so don't have to pay money or use up limited free resources resources of Firebase or other db. Firebase keeps track of
number bytes read to and from db. Instead, use flask backend which save to local file system, until ready to deploy. Be
Sure to change the 'mode' parameter for all api calls to 'production' before deployment. 'mode' should always be the
first parameter.
