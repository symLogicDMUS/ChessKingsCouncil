1. saving piece using sample images did not add img_ref (correct)
2. uploading an image for Goolge and guest successfully puts storage image in db. However, when switching users after image
   has been displayed and rendered and then saving the piece results in an increment to an image ref for the new user that points to a location in
   the old users folder.
