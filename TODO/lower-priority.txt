short:
* tweak appearance of play-as on bottom-bar of createPiece
* Make z-index of NavBar one higher than everything except the Modals
* Add hover color to NavBar.
* make 'Shockwave' color of checkbox match the theme (not pink)
* change color of close icon on hover from red to something else (seen in displayBoardModal). maybe a light grey

medium:
* Have clicking the help Icon toggle the help model.
* remove .css and .css.map from git, figure out how to include all files of certain extension in gitignore
* make use stepFuncDict the same across components. shouldn't need a dict for both angles as keys, and one func names as keys
* organize DisplayBoardModal styles like did with CreatePieces

long:
* add new and different themes
* add multiple versions of standard game (Star Wars, NBA etc)
* optimise style methods, maybe only called at top/page level components and then passed as props
* look into scss with font-size used as units. Read about
* make some of the tools/modals in desktop version draggable, including Range display board in GameRoot and Customize
