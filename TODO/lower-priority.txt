short:
* decide if radio buttons shaped like chess pieces, or a dropdown, looks better for sub pieces. Would need to shrink the
  height of dropdown in later case.
* have confirm modal fly in from the bottom
* have save successful message for GameRoot and createPiece be animated and use svg Garamond font text
* make 'Shockwave' color of checkbox match the theme (not pink)
* consider making the image that Piece component renders, a Material UI Avatar

medium:
* Make functional Components in addition to class components be a default export, to be consistent
* go and through every document and use the Prettier command..
* Have clicking the help Icon toggle the help model.
* make stepFuncDict import the same across components. shouldn't need a dict for both angles as keys, and one func names as keys

long:
* add new and different themes
* add multiple versions of standard game (Star Wars, NBA etc)
