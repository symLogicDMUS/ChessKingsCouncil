short:
* even out vertical spacing between Icon, Range, Location, and Options, use Material UI's Divider component from
   permenant drawer demo.
* background image is its own top level component. Don't make everything child of it.
* have confirm modal fly in from the bottom
* have save successful message for GameRoot and createPiece be animated and use svg Garamond font text
* fix label and expand widget on RangeDisplayTool
* Make z-index of NavBar one higher than everything except the Modals
* make 'Shockwave' color of checkbox match the theme (not pink)
* consider making the image that Piece component renders, a Material UI Avatar

medium:
* Make functional Components in addition to class components be a default export, to be consistent
* go and through every document and use the Prettier command..
* Have clicking the help Icon toggle the help model.
* make stepFuncDict import the same across components. shouldn't need a dict for both angles as keys, and one func names as keys

long:
* add new and different themes
* add multiple versions of standard game (Star Wars, NBA etc)
