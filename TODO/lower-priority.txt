short:
    change color of Close Icon for Location and Range MiniVariant tools on hover
    for SubDropdown, decide if want to keep list items both icons and text, or just have icons
    new icon of a board for Load Game modal
    consider making tool buttons text/icons bigger.
medium:
    * test with red and blue piece colors.
    * memoize createPieceBoard.
    * add to settings, option to choose between light board style and dark board style (for all themes)
    * consistent border radius especially on CreatePiece page.
    * figure out how to get slightly larger border for touch screen devices. (buttons, modal borders, etc.)
    consider making MechWarrior fill a texture, if possible.
long:
    * consider adding new function for GameBoard image strings back to SavedGames MuiGrid component
    * Make functional Components in addition to class components be a default export, to be consistent.
    * go and through every document and add documentation as well as use the Prettier command on file.
    * find all zIndex, make theme organized in right order with no unnecessary gaps in numbering
