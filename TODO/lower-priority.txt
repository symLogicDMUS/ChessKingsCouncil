short:
    Play button in new game too wide
    for SubDropdown, decide if want to keep list items both icons and text, or just have icons
    replace ImgWindows Icons from Image icon to AddPhoto icon
    new icon of a board for Load Game modal
    fix background board tile decoration for skinner screen widths (less than 1040px)
    consider making tool buttons text/icons bigger.
medium:
    * modification of styles of of Promo modal
    * consistent border radius especially on CreatePiece page.
    * figure out how to get slightly larger border for touch screen devices. (buttons, modal borders, etc.)
long:
    * Make functional Components in addition to class components be a default export, to be consistent.
    * go and through every document and add documentation as well as use the Prettier command on file.
